     * loop new
     * objects are been created beacuse Strings are immutable. Here reference var.
     * string will be pointing to new object which will create a new space in the
     * memory and in each iteration these objects will have no reference var.
     * pointing towards them Eg. ["a", "ab", "abc", "abcd",
     * "abcde"......"abcdefghij.......y"] here all these objects are causing a loss
     * of memory and extra space.
     * Each iteration is on O(N^2)
     * Once a object is created in String we cannot modify that object.
