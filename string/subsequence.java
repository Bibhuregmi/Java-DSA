/*
 * Base Case:
 * - If the input string `str` is empty, the method creates a new `ArrayList`,
 * adds the current subsequence `e` to it, and returns this list. This
 * represents the end of a branch in the recursion tree where no more characters
 * are left to process.
 * Recursive Case:
 * - The method processes the first character of `str`, which is stored in `ch`.
 * - It recursively generates all subsequences including this character by
 * calling `subsequence(e + ch, str.substring(1))`. This updates `e` by adding
 * `ch` and processes the remaining string.
 * - It recursively generates all subsequences excluding this character by
 * calling `subsequence(e, str.substring(1))`. This keeps `e` unchanged and
 * processes the remaining string.
 * Combining Results:
 * - The results from the two recursive calls (`left` and `right`) are combined.
 * `left` contains all subsequences that include the current character `ch`,
 * while `right` contains all subsequences that do not include `ch`.
 * - The method adds all subsequences from `right` to the `left` list and
 * returns this combined list.
